# Just / Make

This repository host readymade `justfiles` / `makefiles` for projects.

The goal is to hide implementation details of project management behind unified recipe names.
In any project `just test` should *just* run the tests without the need for the developer to know anything about the tools used for that purpose.
Same goes for linting and formating and even, to some extent, for installing the project in development mode.
